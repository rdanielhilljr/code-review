        <p>I am originally from Little Rock, AR. In 2002 my best friend and I decided to move to Portland to finish college and experience the north west. My orijinal plan was to live in Portland for a few years then move back. However, I quickly fell in love with the city and decided to stay for good!</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, playing disc golf, traveling, camping, backpacking, and trying many different beers and wine offered in our beautiful city. In addition to these interest, I am also an avid music lover and you can usually find me at one of Portland's many music venues on a Friday or Saturday evening.

          <div class="photo2"style="text-align: center"><img src="img/professional.jpg" height="500px" width="300px" /></div>

        <p>I am currently attending Epicodus in pursuit of Web Development skills that will allow for a career in mobile application development. I attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2000 to study Nursing and quikly realized that I wanted to explore a different field. In 2007 I graduated from George Fox University with a degree in Management Business Information Systems. Currently, I am a Bar Director at a family owned restaurant in Lake Oswego. In addition to my customer service duties, I also handle inventory ordering/management, and also help maintain content for our website. I really enjoy building relationships with people and hope that my technical and communication skills will lead to a rewarding career path.</p>
