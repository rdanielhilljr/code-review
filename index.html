        <p>I am originally from Little Rock, AR. In 2002 my best friend and I decided to move to Portland to finish college and experience the north west. My orijinal plan was to live in Portland for a few years then move back. However, I quickly fell in love with the city and decided to stay for good!</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, playing disc golf, traveling, camping, backpacking, and trying many different beers and wine offered in our beautiful city. In addition to these interest, I am also an avid music lover and you can usually find me at one of Portland's many music venues on a Friday or Saturday evening.
